# Notiefi

## What Is Notiefi?

Much of students' communication is done in group chats, and when trying to send resources to one another, stuff gets messy, leaving you to have to scroll through many messages to find exactly what you need. Notiefi creates a platform that compiles all valuable resources for students depending on their enrolled course. Students are able to post notes for each lecture in their course, and these notes can be viewed by future students as well, making them not go to waste. Apart from posting notes, students can also post helpful resources such as links or visualizers that will enable other students to understand a concept even further for that lecture.

Unlike Course Hero, which provides students with resources, Notiefi will not have students be anonymized to create a more tight-knit conversation between students of those courses. Instead, students will be able to converse with one another and even leave each other comments on the notes or resources that're posted. We believe that basic features such as viewing notes should be completely free and not monetized by a third party, leaving the one who uploaded it with nothing to gain and only that third party with the monetary gain.

## For Whom is Notiefi For?

Notiefi is by students for students.

Students are sometimes left to scour the internet to try to compile as many resources as they can to help them during their course, and this occurs with them every semester. Giving students a platform where they can post these resources that they have compiled or notes that they have been writing down will keep on helping the next wave of students that take that course.

Since we ourselves are students, we think that we're able to make better judgments as to what should be implemented since we will be creating something that we think that we see ourselves using and benefitting us during our time studying for our courses.

## How Will We Implement Notiefi?

Before students can use Notiefi, we first have to verify that they *are* a student and what college they're attending.

Students will be asked to provide their email, and they will be placed into their respective college using the domain name from the email address. Once the user is signed in, they can search for their courses and add them to their account so they can come back to them with ease.

There are two sides to each course tab, the chatting side and the categorized resource and note sharing side. On the chatting side, students will be able to converse with one another as just a regular group chat where they're free to speak about whatever they'd like and even create new connections with each other. On the resource and note sharing side, students will be able to view the lectures, and upon clicking on a lecture, they will be met with a Reddit type of design where they will be able to view the different posts that consist of notes and resources and upvote them or downvote them.

Posts are automatically sorted by the highest upvotes to make the posts with the highest quality rank first and for students not to have to figure out which one is the best. Students will also be able to report posts for any academic integrity violations that will automatically be redirected to the instructor of that course. Since there is no anonymity upon registration, any reported post could be dealt with accordingly by the instructor.

## Scope

For user registration, we can simply use Google's OAuth to get the user's email and full name without implementing much for verification.

Although the idea of having to add every college's course sounds complex, we think we're able to accomplish it by just parsing each college's catalog and accomplishing something that's similar to [Coursicle](https://www.coursicle.com/).

We also think that with React, we're able to accomplish most of what we have in mind for the design of the site and the specific pages that were mentioned earlier.
