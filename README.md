## What Is *Insert Product Name*?
Though platforms like SoundCloud, Spotify, and Apple Music connect listeners to musical artists, there exists no community platform to connect artists to producers. There are sites like [SoundBetter](https://soundbetter.com/s/producers) and [Vocalizr](https://vocalizr.com/producers) that do connect artists to producers; however, these platforms act more like freelancing websites such as [UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/hire/landing/?utm_campaign=SEM_GGL_DOMESTIC_Brand_Marketplace_Core_Exact&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=124555474489&utm_term=upwork&campaignid=12964345678&matchtype=e&device=c&partnerId=EAIaIQobChMIqPq_6YvV9QIV4nxvBB0x7QOqEAAYASAAEgLvlPD_BwE&utm_source=google&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqPq_6YvV9QIV4nxvBB0x7QOqEAAYASAAEgLvlPD_BwE) and [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc-brand&utm_campaign=G_US_Brand_BrandingDeskTop_Exact&utm_term=one-fiverr_(exact)&utm_content=AdID%5e549600552450%5eKeyword%5efiverr%5ePlacement%5e%5eDevice%5ec&caid=731898203&agid=43879774452&ad_id=549600552450&kw=fiverr&lpcat=br_general&show_join=true&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIkb2f84vV9QIVhSs4Ch3mig7lEAAYASAAEgIvifD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). As streaming becomes more popular, creating music becomes more accessible. Therefore, a platform that fosters connections between  upcoming artists and producers should be established. 


 *Insert Product Name* is an online community platform that integrates with SoundCloud to connect artists and producers. Our app structure is similar to that of Tinder. A user can create a profile through the SoundCloud and include from our default list of genres the genre(s) that they primarily make music in. A user can then swipe through other artists or producers, choosing the ones they would like to message. However, our app carefully curates the potential connections that a user sees, matching each artist with other artists in similar genres, popularity, and working styles. 

 ## For Whom is *Insert Product Name* For?

*Insert Product Name* is for artists and producers to create connections together. 

Many artists just starting out don't have the resources or knowledge necessary to produce  music. Subsequently, many producers just starting out need artists on which they can practice. 

More established artists and producers can also find valuable connections using *Insert Product Name*. By checking if an artist is verified or trending, we can also ensure that such users are connected based on skill level and relevance. 

## How Will We Implement *Insert Product Name*?

A user will log onto our platform using their SoundCloud login. Once their account has been made, they will be directed to creating their profile. On their profile, they will choose which snippets from songs on their SoundCloud they would like to include, as well as which genres they mainly make music in and a brief description of the type of connection they are looking for. Users will also have the option to filter through artists, producers, or both. 

On the main page, a user will be able to swipe through artists and/or producers that make music in similar genres, have similar skill levels, and are comparably popular. However, this algorithm will include some mixing so that artists or producers just starting out are able to make connections with more established users, and more established users don't overlook the talent of those just starting out. 

If a user swipes left on another user, the swiped user will be disregarded from the curated grouping of users for a certain period of time. However, if two users swipe right on each other, both have access to each other's direct messages and begin to make that connection.

## Scope

SoundCloud has an extensive [API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide) that gives developers access to user authentication, track plays, follower counts, and track management. Therefore, because of the easy access to SoundCloud data, issues with collecting user data should be minimized. 

Furthermore, the architecture of our we app is quite simple, consisting of the home page, a profile page, and a direct message page (not including login and logout).

The most challenging aspect of our app is the matching algorithm, but because this is based on data that is accessible by SoundCloud, the process of creating this algorithm should not be too challening to complete in one semester of work.
